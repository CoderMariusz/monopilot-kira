# Manufacturing KPI Dashboard — Orchestration Pipeline Plan

## Overview

This document defines the full orchestration pipeline for building the Manufacturing KPI Dashboard. The **Orchestrator** coordinates work across 13 stories, delegating each story through a **3-step pipeline** to specialized agents.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 3-Step Pipeline Per Story

Each story goes through exactly 3 steps before being marked complete:

### Step Details

| Step | Agent Mode | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **1. Implement** | Code | Build the feature from the story spec | Story MD file + existing codebase | Working feature with all ACs met |
| **2. Refactor** | Code | Clean, optimize, and polish | Implemented code from Step 1 | Production-quality code |
| **3. Review/QA** | Review | Verify quality and correctness | Refactored code from Step 2 | Approval or list of issues |

### Feedback Loop

If the Review/QA step finds issues:
1. Orchestrator creates a **fix task** with the specific issues listed
2. Fix task goes to **Code mode** for resolution
3. After fixes, a **quick re-review** confirms resolution
4. Story is marked complete only when Review passes

---

## Story Execution Order

Stories are executed **sequentially** respecting dependency chains. No parallel execution to avoid merge conflicts and ensure each story builds on a stable foundation.

### Dependency Graph
