# DISCOVERY-FLOW

> **Version:** 1.0
> **Definition:** @.claude/workflows/definitions/product/new-project.yaml
> **Updated:** 2025-12-10

---

## Purpose

Ensure complete project understanding before planning or development begins.
This workflow is MANDATORY before:
- New project initialization
- Existing project migration
- New epic planning
- Major feature additions

**IMPORTANT:** Discovery is NOT optional. Skipping discovery leads to wrong assumptions, wasted effort, and costly rework. This workflow ensures we always ask questions and understand the project before acting.

> **NOTE: UX Design is NOT part of Discovery.** Discovery gathers basic UI/UX context (platforms, accessibility needs, UI preference) but actual UX Design happens LATER in the Planning flow, AFTER Architecture is defined. UX Design requires technical context from Architecture to make informed decisions.
>
> **Correct flow sequence:** Discovery -> PRD -> Architecture -> UX Design -> Epic Breakdown -> Stories -> Sprint

## Trigger Points

| Trigger | Source | Entry Phase | Depth | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| New project | init-interactive.sh | Phase 1 | deep | Full discovery required |
| Migration | migrate-docs.sh | Phase 1 | quick | Quick context, then migrate |
| New Epic | ORCHESTRATOR | Phase 2 | standard | Project known, focus on epic |
| Unclear requirements | Any agent | Phase 4 | quick | Fast-track to gaps |

### Depth Selection Logic

```
IF new_project AND greenfield:
    depth = deep
    clarity_target = 85%

ELIF migration:
    depth = quick
    clarity_target = 50%
    skip_if: scan found complete docs

ELIF new_epic:
    depth = standard
    clarity_target = 70%

ELIF clarification:
    depth = quick (targeted)
    clarity_target = 90% (for specific topic)
```

## Phase Details

---

### Phase 1: Initial Scan (Quick)

**Agent:** DOC-AUDITOR (quick mode)
**Model:** Sonnet
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes

#### Why This Phase Matters
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it delivers** | Quick overview of project structure and existing documentation |
| **If skipped** | Miss existing docs, duplicate work, overlook constraints |
| **Problems prevented** | Reinventing the wheel, conflicting with existing decisions |

#### Activities
1. Scan project directory structure
2. Identify existing documentation files
3. List key configuration files
4. Note technology indicators (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
5. Create initial overview document

#### Output
- `docs/0-DISCOVERY/INITIAL-SCAN.md`

#### Gate: SCAN_COMPLETE

```markdown
## Gate: SCAN_COMPLETE

Condition: Initial project scan completed
Validation:
- [ ] Project structure mapped
- [ ] Existing documentation identified
- [ ] Key files listed
- [ ] Technology stack indicators noted

Blocking: Cannot proceed to Phase 2 until passed
Recovery: Re-run scan with expanded scope
```

---

### Phase 2: Discovery Interview

**Agent:** DISCOVERY-AGENT
**Model:** Sonnet (Opus for complex domains)
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

#### Why This Phase Matters
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it delivers** | Core understanding of project goals, users, and requirements |
| **If skipped** | Building wrong product, misaligned expectations |
| **Problems prevented** | Scope creep, wasted development, user dissatisfaction |

#### Interview Structure

```markdown
## Discovery Interview Template

### Vision & Goals
1. What is the primary purpose of this project?
2. What problem does it solve?
3. What does success look like?

### Users & Personas
1. Who are the target users?
2. What are their main pain points?
3. How tech-savvy are they?

### Features & Requirements
1. What are the must-have features?
2. What are nice-to-have features?
3. Are there any features explicitly out of scope?

### Constraints
1. What is the timeline?
2. What is the budget (if applicable)?
3. Are there technical constraints?
4. Are there regulatory/compliance requirements?

### Context
1. Is this a new project or replacing something?
2. Are there existing systems to integrate with?
3. Who are the stakeholders?

### UI/UX Context (Basic - NOT full UX design)
1. Does this project need a user interface?
2. What platforms are required? (web, mobile, desktop)
3. Are there accessibility requirements? (WCAG level)
4. Any existing brand guidelines or design system to follow?
5. Preference for UI approach? (minimalist, feature-rich, etc.)

> Note: These questions gather CONTEXT only. Full UX Design happens
> after Architecture is defined in the Planning flow.

### Phase 3: Domain-Specific Questions (Parallel)

**Agents:** ARCHITECT-AGENT, PM-AGENT, RESEARCH-AGENT (parallel)
**Models:** Opus (Architect), Sonnet (PM, Research)
**Duration:** 10-20 minutes

> **Note:** UX-DESIGNER is intentionally NOT included in Discovery parallel agents.
> UX Design requires technical context from Architecture decisions (tech stack, platform constraints,
> performance budgets) to make informed design choices. UX Design phase occurs AFTER Architecture
> in the Planning flow.

#### Why This Phase Matters
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it delivers** | Deep domain understanding from technical, business, and research perspectives |
| **If skipped** | Miss critical technical/business requirements |
| **Problems prevented** | Architecture mismatches, market misalignment, unknown unknowns |

#### Gate: DOMAINS_COVERED

```markdown
## Gate: DOMAINS_COVERED

Condition: All domain perspectives captured
Validation:
- [ ] Technical requirements understood
- [ ] Business context clear
- [ ] Unknowns documented

```

---

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis

**Agents:** DOC-AUDITOR + DISCOVERY-AGENT
**Model:** Sonnet
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

#### Why This Phase Matters
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it delivers** | Clear list of what we still don't know and how to resolve it |
| **If skipped** | Proceed with hidden gaps, face surprises later |
| **Problems prevented** | Late-stage discoveries, blocked development, incorrect assumptions |

#### Activities
1. Review all discovery outputs
2. Identify remaining gaps
3. List open questions
4. Prioritize unknowns by:
   - Impact on architecture
   - Impact on timeline
   - Risk if wrong
5. Determine if gaps are blocking
6. Propose resolution strategies

#### Gap Categories

| Category | Examples | Resolution Strategy |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Blocking** | Missing security requirements | Must resolve before planning |
| **Important** | Unclear performance targets | Resolve during planning |
| **Minor** | Nice-to-have feature details | Resolve during development |
| **Deferred** | Future integrations | Document for later |

#### Output
- `docs/0-DISCOVERY/GAPS-AND-QUESTIONS.md`

#### Gate: GAPS_IDENTIFIED

```markdown
## Gate: GAPS_IDENTIFIED

Condition: Gap analysis completed
Validation:
- [ ] All gaps documented
- [ ] Open questions listed
- [ ] Priorities assigned (Blocking/Important/Minor/Deferred)
- [ ] Resolution strategies proposed
- [ ] No blocking gaps remaining OR resolution plan in place

Blocking: Cannot proceed to Phase 5 until passed
Recovery: Return to Phase 2/3 for specific gap resolution
```

---

### Phase 5: Confirmation

**Agent:** ORCHESTRATOR
**Model:** Opus 4.5
**Duration:** 5 minutes

#### Why This Phase Matters
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it delivers** | User-validated understanding document |
| **If skipped** | Proceed with unvalidated assumptions |
| **Problems prevented** | Misunderstandings, wrong direction, wasted effort |

#### Activities
1. Compile understanding summary
2. Present to user in clear format
3. Highlight key decisions and assumptions
4. Ask for explicit confirmation
5. Handle corrections and additions
6. Finalize documentation

#### Confirmation Summary Template

## CRITICAL: Why Discovery Cannot Be Skipped

```
WITHOUT DISCOVERY:
- Build wrong product
- Miss critical requirements
- Make incorrect assumptions
- Face costly late-stage changes
- Frustrate users and stakeholders

WITH DISCOVERY:
- Clear understanding
- Validated requirements
- Documented assumptions
- Aligned expectations
- Smooth development
```

**Remember:** The cost of discovery is 45-60 minutes. The cost of building the wrong thing is weeks or months.
