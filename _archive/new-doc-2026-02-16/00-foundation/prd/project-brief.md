## Executive Summary

MonoPilot is a cloud-native Manufacturing Execution System (MES) purpose-built for small-to-medium food manufacturers (5-100 employees). The system addresses a critical market gap: food producers who have outgrown Excel-based tracking but cannot justify the cost, complexity, and 6-24 month implementation timelines of enterprise solutions like SAP or Dynamics 365.

**Value Proposition:** MonoPilot provides the essential MES functionality - production planning, traceability, inventory management, and quality control - with deployment measured in weeks rather than months, at a fraction of enterprise pricing. The system is designed for self-service configuration, eliminating the need for external consultants.

**Market Positioning:** Cloud-native, easy-deploy MES positioned between manual spreadsheet chaos and heavyweight enterprise ERP systems. Purpose-built for food industry compliance (traceability, allergens, lot tracking) while maintaining the simplicity SMBs require.

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective
Capture the underserved Polish SMB food manufacturing market by providing an affordable, rapidly deployable MES solution that meets regulatory requirements without enterprise complexity.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **EU Expansion** - Extend to DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and broader EU market post-Polish market validation
2. **Vertical Depth** - Become the recognized MES leader for food manufacturing SMBs through purpose-built features (allergens, traceability, HACCP support)
3. **Platform Revenue** - Build recurring SaaS revenue model with high customer retention through integration stickiness

| **Technical** | 2 | Products, BOMs, routings, allergen management, traceability foundation | Must Have |
| **Planning** | 3 | Purchase orders, transfer orders, work orders, supplier management | Must Have |
| **Production** | 4 | WO execution, material consumption, outputs, yield tracking, scanner workflows | Must Have |
| **Warehouse** | 5 | License plates, GRN, stock movements, FIFO/FEFO, scanner receive/pick/move | Must Have |
| **Quality** | 6 | QA status, holds, specifications, NCR, CoA management | Should Have |
| **Shipping** | 7 | Sales orders, picking, packing, shipments, carrier integration | Should Have |

### Out of Scope (Phase 2+)

| Module | Epic | Description | Planned Phase | Rationale |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **NPD** | 8 | New Product Development, stage-gate, trial BOMs | Phase 2 | Enterprise feature, not MVP-critical |
| **Finance** | 9 | Cost variance, margins, accounting export (NOT full GL/AR/AP) | Phase 2 | Integrate with existing accounting systems |
| **OEE** | 10 | Overall Equipment Effectiveness, machine performance | Phase 3 | Requires shop floor data integration |
| **Integrations** | 11 | Comarch Optima, EDI, customer/supplier portals | Phase 3 | Post-MVP enhancement |
| **Multi-Site** | - | Multiple warehouse/plant locations under one org | Phase 3 | SMB focus is single-site |
| **AI/ML Features** | - | Demand forecasting, anomaly detection | Phase 4+ | Avoid "me too" AI |
| **Full ERP** | - | General ledger, accounts receivable/payable, HR | Never | Not core MES, integrate externally |

### Exclusions (Never)
- **On-premise deployment** - Cloud-only SaaS model
- **Full accounting module** - Integrate with Comarch, Sage, wFirma
- **HR/Payroll** - Out of scope, separate domain
- **CRM** - Integrate with existing CRM systems
- **Custom development per customer** - Product-led, not project-led
