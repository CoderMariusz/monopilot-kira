## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Module Purpose

The Planning Module handles "how we order and schedule" - managing the complete lifecycle of:

- **Suppliers** - Vendor master data, supplier-product relationships, lead times
- **Purchase Orders (PO)** - Procurement from external suppliers
- **Transfer Orders (TO)** - Internal inventory movements between warehouses
- **Work Orders (WO)** - Production scheduling with BOM snapshots
- **Demand Planning** - Forecasting, MRP, auto-replenishment (Phase 2+)

### 1.2 Business Value

| Value Driver | Benefit | Metric |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Reduced stockouts | Automated reorder points prevent production stops | Target: <2% stockout rate |
| Faster procurement | Bulk PO creation saves 70% of manual entry time | Target: <5 min for 20-line PO |
| Better visibility | Dashboard shows all orders in one place | Target: 100% real-time accuracy |
| Compliance | Full audit trail for supplier and order history | Target: Pass audits in <30 min |
| Material planning | BOM-driven material requirements | Target: 95% first-pass WO completion |

### 1.3 Scope

**In Scope (Phase 1):**
- Supplier master data management
- Purchase Order CRUD with approval workflow
- Transfer Order management with LP selection
- Work Order creation with BOM snapshot
- Basic planning dashboard
- Configurable status lifecycles

**In Scope (Phase 2):**
- Demand forecasting (historical-based)
- MRP/MPS basic implementation
- Auto-replenishment rules
- PO templates and blanket POs
- Safety stock management
- Reorder point calculations

**In Scope (Phase 3):**
- Finite capacity planning
- Supplier quality management (scorecards, audits)

## 7. Section 4: Work Orders

### 7.1 Overview

Work Orders (WO) represent production jobs. When created, the WO captures a snapshot of the BOM and optionally the Routing, which becomes immutable during production.

### 7.2 WO Header Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Auto | Primary key |
| `org_id` | UUID | Yes | Organization (RLS) |
| `wo_number` | string | Auto | Unique WO number (e.g., WO-2024-00001) |
| `product_id` | UUID | Yes | Product to produce |
| `bom_id` | UUID | Yes | BOM used (auto-selected or override) |
| `routing_id` | UUID | No | Routing used (optional) |

| `source_reference` | string | No | Reference number (PO-001, ORD-123) |
| `expiry_date` | date | No | WO expiry (auto-close after this date) |
| `notes` | text | No | Production notes |
| `started_at` | timestamp | No | Actual start time |

| `created_at` | timestamp | Auto | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | Auto | Last update |
| `created_by` | UUID | Auto | Creator |

### 7.3 BOM Auto-Selection

**Logic:**
1. User selects Product and Scheduled Date
2. System queries active BOMs for product:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM boms
   WHERE product_id = :product_id
     AND status = 'active'
     AND effective_from <= :scheduled_date
     AND (effective_to IS NULL OR effective_to >= :scheduled_date)
   ORDER BY effective_from DESC
   LIMIT 1
   ```
3. If multiple match, select most recent `effective_from`
4. User can override selection
5. If no active BOM found, show warning but allow manual selection

### 7.3.1 BOM-Routing Relationship

**Key Concept:** Work Orders inherit routing from BOM, not directly from product.

**Data Model:**
- `boms` table has `routing_id` FK to `routings` table (added in migration 045)
- BOM references a specific routing version
- When WO is created, routing is inherited from the selected BOM

**Cascade Logic:**
```
Product → BOM (with routing_id) → Work Order
         ↓
      Routing → WO Operations (snapshot)
```

**Business Rules:**
- BOM can have `routing_id = NULL` (no routing assigned)
- If BOM has routing, WO inherits that routing by default
- If BOM has no routing, user can optionally assign routing at WO creation
- WO routing snapshot is immutable after WO release (same as BOM snapshot)
- Changing BOM's routing does NOT affect existing WOs (immutability)

**Why BOM → Routing instead of Product → Routing:**
- Different BOM versions may use different routings
- Allows routing evolution over time alongside BOM changes
- Maintains full traceability: WO knows exact BOM + Routing combination used

### 7.4 WO Materials (BOM Snapshot)

**At WO creation, BOM items are copied to `wo_materials`:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `wo_id` | UUID | FK to work_orders |
| `product_id` | UUID | Material product |
| `quantity` | decimal | Required qty (scaled from BOM) |
| `uom` | enum | Unit of measure |
| `scrap_percent` | decimal | Expected scrap % |
| `consume_whole_lp` | boolean | 1:1 LP consumption flag |
| `is_by_product` | boolean | By-product flag |
| `yield_percent` | decimal | By-product yield |
| `condition_flags` | jsonb | Conditional flags (organic, vegan, etc.) |
| `operation_id` | UUID | Assigned operation (Phase 2) |
| `consumed_qty` | decimal | Actually consumed (updated during production) |
| `reserved_qty` | decimal | Reserved from inventory |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Creation time |

**Quantity Scaling:**
```
wo_material.quantity = bom_item.quantity * (wo.quantity / bom.output_qty) * (1 + scrap_percent/100)
```

**Immutability:** Once WO status = `released`, `wo_materials` cannot be modified (even if source BOM changes).

### 7.5 WO Operations (Routing Copy)

**When `wo_copy_routing = true` in Settings:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `wo_id` | UUID | FK to work_orders |
| `sequence` | integer | Operation order |
| `operation_name` | string | Operation name |
| `description` | text | Operation description |
| `machine_id` | UUID | Assigned machine |
| `line_id` | UUID | Assigned line |
| `expected_duration_minutes` | integer | Planned duration |
| `expected_yield_percent` | decimal | Expected yield |
| `actual_duration_minutes` | integer | Actual duration (filled during production) |
| `actual_yield_percent` | decimal | Actual yield |
| `status` | enum | not_started, in_progress, completed |
| `started_at` | timestamp | Start time |
| `completed_at` | timestamp | Completion time |
| `started_by` | UUID | Operator who started |
| `completed_by` | UUID | Operator who completed |
| `notes` | text | Operation notes |

### 7.6 Material Availability Check

**At WO creation (if `wo_material_check = true` in Settings):**

1. Calculate required materials from BOM snapshot
2. Query available inventory:
   ```sql
   SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) as available
   FROM license_plates
   WHERE product_id IN (:material_ids)
     AND warehouse_id = :warehouse_id
     AND status = 'available'
   GROUP BY product_id
   ```
3. Compare required vs available
4. Display warnings:
   - Green: available >= required * 1.2 (comfortable)
   - Yellow: required <= available < required * 1.2 (low)
   - Red: available < required (insufficient)
5. User can proceed despite warnings (materials may be incoming)

### 7.7 Material Reservation (Phase 1)

**Soft Reservation:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `wo_id` | UUID | FK to work_orders |
| `wo_material_id` | UUID | FK to wo_materials |
| `lp_id` | UUID | Reserved LP |
| `quantity` | decimal | Reserved quantity |
| `reserved_at` | timestamp | Reservation time |
| `reserved_by` | UUID | User who reserved |
| `released_at` | timestamp | Release time (if cancelled) |

**Rules:**
- Reservations are "soft" - don't block other WOs
- Reserved LPs shown with indicator in warehouse views
- On WO cancellation, reservations auto-release
- On WO completion, reservations converted to consumption

### 7.8 WO Status Lifecycle

   - From Forecasts (predicted demand)

2. **Scheduled Receipts**
   - Open PO lines not yet received
   - Open TO lines incoming
   - Open WO outputs (for WIP/components)

3. **Projected Available**
   ```
   Projected Available = On Hand + Scheduled Receipts - Gross Requirements
   ```

4. **Net Requirements**
   ```
   If Projected Available < Safety Stock:
     Net Requirement = Gross Requirement - Projected Available + Safety Stock
   ```

5. **Planned Order Release**
   ```
   Order Date = Requirement Date - Lead Time - Buffer Days
   Order Qty = MAX(Net Requirement, MOQ, Economic Order Qty)
   ```

## 22. Assumptions & Decisions

### 22.1 Validated Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Validated By | Date |
|----|------------|--------------|------|
| A-01 | Organizations use single currency per supplier | Discovery interviews | 2025-11-15 |
| A-02 | PO approval workflow is optional feature | User feedback | 2025-11-20 |
| A-03 | BOM immutability after WO release is required | Production team | 2025-11-22 |
| A-04 | Lead time in days is sufficient granularity | Pilot users | 2025-11-25 |
| A-05 | Safety stock calculated in days of demand | Industry standard | 2025-11-28 |

### 22.2 Open Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Status |
|----|------------|-----------------|--------|
| A-06 | Moving average is sufficient for initial forecasting | Inaccurate forecasts - need more methods | Needs validation |
| A-07 | EDI integration via third-party gateway | More integration work if direct | Needs decision |
| A-08 | Capacity planning by line/machine sufficient | May need operator scheduling | Phase 3 scope |

### 22.3 Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| No full ERP finance module | Focus on MES core, integrate with external | 2025-10-01 |
| LP-based inventory only | Ensures traceability, industry best practice | 2025-10-01 |
| Soft reservation (not hard) | Flexibility over rigid allocation | 2025-11-15 |
| Phase MRP features (not MVP) | Complexity vs time-to-market | 2025-11-20 |
| Phase 3 for capacity planning | Enterprise feature, SMB can use basic | 2025-11-28 |
