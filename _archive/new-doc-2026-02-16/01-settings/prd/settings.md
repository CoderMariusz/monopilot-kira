#### FR-SET-018: User Warehouse Access Restrictions

**Priority:** P1 (Phase 1B - Infrastructure)
**Phase:** 1B
**Module Area:** Users
**Dependencies:** FR-SET-040 (Warehouses CRUD)

**Description:**
Restrict user access to specific warehouses. Users can only view and modify inventory in warehouses they have been granted access to. Super admins and admins have access to all warehouses by default.

**User Story:**
As an admin, I want to restrict which warehouses a user can access, so that multi-warehouse operations maintain proper data isolation and users only see relevant inventory.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GIVEN user has access to WH-001 only, WHEN viewing inventory module, THEN only WH-001 inventory displays
- GIVEN admin assigns warehouse access in user profile, WHEN user logs in, THEN only assigned warehouses appear in warehouse dropdown filters
- GIVEN user has no warehouse access assigned, WHEN accessing warehouse-dependent modules, THEN error message "No warehouse access configured" displays
- GIVEN super_admin or admin role, WHEN accessing any module, THEN all warehouses are accessible (bypass restriction)
- GIVEN user warehouse access is changed, WHEN user refreshes page, THEN new access permissions apply immediately

**Business Rules:**
- Default: New users have NO warehouse access (must be explicitly granted)
- Exception: super_admin and admin roles bypass restrictions (access all)
- Access levels: read, write (future: admin per warehouse)
- Cascading delete: If warehouse is deleted, remove all user_warehouse_access records
- Audit: Track who granted/revoked access and when

**UI/UX:**
- User profile modal: Multi-select dropdown for warehouse access assignment
- Warehouse filter: Only show warehouses user has access to
- Error handling: Clear message if user tries to access restricted warehouse

**API:**
- GET /api/settings/users/:id/warehouse-access
- PUT /api/settings/users/:id/warehouse-access

**Database:**
- Table: user_warehouse_access (user_id, warehouse_id, access_level, created_at, created_by)

**Related:**
- Wireframe: SET-009 (User Create/Edit Modal, lines 49-105)
- Architecture: user_warehouse_access table (lines 338-348)

---

#### Multi-Language Deferral Justification

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Decision:** Defer multi-language support (FR-SET-110 to FR-SET-116) from Phase 1A to Phase 1B
**Affected Requirements:** FR-SET-110, FR-SET-111, FR-SET-112, FR-SET-113, FR-SET-114, FR-SET-115, FR-SET-116

**Rationale:**
1. **Phase 1A Focus:** Core functionality (authentication, users, organizations, roles, module toggles, onboarding wizard) takes priority
2. **MVP Viability:** English-only MVP is sufficient for initial customers and market validation
3. **Complexity Reduction:** Multi-language adds i18n infrastructure complexity without blocking core workflows
4. **UI Stabilization:** Phase 1B timing allows UI patterns to stabilize before adding translation layer
5. **Epic 01 Scope:** Epic 01 already contains 7 stories (maximum recommended); adding multi-language would exceed optimal batch size

**Impact:**
- MVP launches English-only
- Multi-language added in Phase 1B alongside infrastructure configuration
- No technical debt created: i18n library already chosen (next-intl), translation keys reserved in codebase

**Technical Preparation (Phase 1A):**
- Install next-intl package
- Configure i18n routing structure
- Use translation keys in new components (hardcoded English values for MVP)
- Translation files created with English values only

**Related Epic:**
- Epic 01: Core Settings (7 stories) - Phase 1A
- Epic 01b: Infrastructure Config (includes multi-language story) - Phase 1B

    And the timezone should default to browser-detected timezone
    And the language should default to browser language (if supported)

  Scenario: Validation on required fields
    Given the wizard is on step 1
    When I leave the organization name empty
    And I click "Next"
    Then an error message "Organization name is required" should appear
    And the wizard should not advance

  Scenario: Navigate back (disabled on first step)
    Given the wizard is on step 1
    Then the "Back" button should be disabled or hidden
```
