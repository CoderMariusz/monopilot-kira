## 5. Business Rules

### 5.1 Products
- SKU (code) must be unique per organization
- SKU is immutable after creation
- Version auto-increments on edit (1.0 -> 1.1 -> 1.2)
- Product type cannot change after creation
- Allergen inheritance auto-calculated from active BOM
- **Perishable products must have shelf_life_days and expiry_policy != 'none'** (migration 046)
- **RM/PKG products should have cost_per_unit set (warning if missing)** (migration 048)

### 5.2 BOMs
- BOM version effective dates cannot overlap for same product
- Database trigger enforces date overlap prevention
- BOM items must reference valid products as ingredients
- Conditional items require valid flag expressions
- Byproducts have yield_percent (e.g., 15% = 15kg from 100kg input)
- Alternative ingredients must be same unit class
- Operation assignment (operation_seq) required for production
- Line-specific items: NULL line_ids = all lines, specific IDs = those lines only
- **Clone action copies all items, routing, notes to new product** (FR-2.24 DONE)
- **BOM items must have quantity > 0** (migration 049)
- **BOM item UoM should match component base UoM (warning if mismatch)** (migration 049)

### 5.3 Routings
- Operations must have unique sequence numbers per routing
- Routing can be reused across multiple BOMs (if is_reusable = true)
- BOM references routing via routing_id
- Labor cost hierarchy: BOM line override > routing operation default
- **Routing code must be unique per organization** (UX: TEC-008)
- **Routing code format: uppercase alphanumeric + hyphens (e.g., RTG-BREAD-01)** (UX: TEC-008)
- **Reusable routings (is_reusable = true) can be shared across multiple products** (UX: TEC-008)
- **Non-reusable routings (is_reusable = false) are product-specific (1:1)** (UX: TEC-008)
- **Routing costs are versioned with routing** (when routing version increments, costs are captured)
- **Cost fields default to 0** (optional, backwards compatible)
- **When routing is cloned, code gets "-COPY" suffix**

### 5.4 Routing Operations
- Operations must have unique sequence numbers within routing
- **Total operation time = setup_time + duration + cleanup_time**
- **cleanup_time is optional, defaults to 0**
- **instructions field is optional, max 2000 characters**

### 5.5 Traceability
- Lot tracking mandatory for all transactions
- Forward trace: lot -> consumed in which lots
- Backward trace: lot <- made from which lots
- Recall simulation requires lot or batch ID
- Genealogy tree shows multi-level relationships
- Link created on consumption registration (work order)

### 5.6 Costing (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Material cost** = SUM(ingredient cost x quantity)
- **Operation labor cost** = SUM(operation.labor_cost_per_hour x duration_hours)
- **Operation setup cost** = SUM(operation.setup_time x labor_rate)
- **Operation cleanup cost** = SUM(operation.cleanup_time x labor_rate)
- **Routing setup cost** = routing.setup_cost (fixed per run)
- **Routing working cost** = routing.working_cost_per_unit x output_quantity
- **Overhead** = subtotal x (routing.overhead_percent / 100)
- **Total routing cost** = operation costs + routing costs + overhead
- **Total product cost** = material cost + total routing cost
- Standard cost calculated from BOM + routing
- Actual cost from production transactions
- Variance = actual - standard
- Cost history retained for audit

### 5.7 Nutrition
- Auto-calculated from ingredient nutrition data
- Sum weighted by ingredient quantity
- Adjusted for yield loss
- Manual override allowed (with audit flag)
- Label format per FDA requirements
- Allergen warnings auto-generated

### 5.8 Shelf Life (IMPLEMENTED)
- Default = min(ingredient shelf lives)
- Processing impact adjustment
- Manual override allowed (override_days field)
- Storage conditions affect calculation
- Expiry date = production date + shelf life
- **product_shelf_life table tracks calculated vs override** (migration 047)
